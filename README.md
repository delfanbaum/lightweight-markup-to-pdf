# Lightweight Markup to PDF Builder

`lwm2pdf` is a Python script for building lightweight markup content into styled PDFs via 
[WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/). 

Please note that is a work in progress and that I don't actually have any idea of what I'm doing! 

## Supported Filetypes

<!---

New edge case for quotes:

"Or maybe whoever heâ€™s sleeping with will be there and will distract him. I wonder who it is. ([.inline-instruction]#Pauses#.) I wonder. ([.inline-instruction]#Pauses#.) And who am I sleeping with? Someone, sometimes."

-->
Currently, `lwm2pdf` supports the following filetypes:

- Asciidoc (_.adoc_ or _.asciidoc_)
- Markdown (_.md_)

## Options

| Option | Description | Required? |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `-i`, `--input` | The file to convert (full or relative path) |  True |
| `-o`, `--output` | Output filename and destination (optional) |  False |
| `-od`,`--output-dir` | Output directory and destination (optional); not recommended for use with the `-o` option |  False |
| `-s`, `--stylesheet` | Select user stylesheet (css) (optional) |  False |
| `-p`, `--preserve-buildfiles` | Preserve buildfiles in output/src in current working directory or buildfile directory | False |
| `-b`',`--buildfile-dir` | Destination for buildfile(s) directory | False |

## Stylesheets and Themes

(To do.) 

A "manuscript" stylesheet is provided and selected as default. 

## Requirements

See _requirements.txt_ for Python requirements. For optimal asciidoc conversion, I strongly recommend installing some version of [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/), but a port of the original `asciidoc` converter is used as a backup.  

## Known Issues

Some known issues include:

- Table handling is not the best
- All footnotes are rendered as end notes (this is a constraint from WeasyPrint)
- No tests :'( (UPDATE: Like two tests!)
- Markdown support is spotty
- Code highlighting is not working as expected.
