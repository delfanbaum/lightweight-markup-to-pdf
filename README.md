# Lightweight Markup to PDF Builder

A Python script to build lightweight markup content (currently asciidoc and markdown to come) into a styled PDF (via weasyprint)

This is a work in progress! 

For Python requirements, see requirements.txt. Asciidoctor is also required if you want to use asciidoc, as is sass if you want to modify the built-in stylesheets.
